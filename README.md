# What-s-the-Weather-Like

This is a weather app using the Open Weather Map API

This project was done for free code camp to fulfill the below requirements.

* A user can see the weather in their current location.
* A user can see a different background depending on the weather.
* A user can press a button to change C to F and vice verse  
* Add your own personal style.

P.S. The open weather map is operating over HTTP so that portion of the script is considered unsafe. In order for the site to work you need to run the "unsafe" javascript.
