# What-s-the-Weather-Like

"[What-s-the-Weather-Like](https://alexander-guesnon.github.io/What-s-the-Weather-Like/)" will tell you what the weather is like in your area, along with the temperature and wind speed. It does this using the *[Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/)*. I made this for a freeCodeCamp challenge (Show the Local Weather).

### Note: 
All images were taken from http://www.publicdomainpictures.net and should all be public domain.
## Outline

The outline of the challenge was:
-  The website will tell you the weather in your current location.
-  The website will give you a different icon or background image depending on the weather.
-  The User can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Usage

The *Open Weather Map API* is blocked by most browsers due to it using an unsafe HTTP connection to send and receive data.
To make the website work properly you need to enable unsafe javascript in your browser.

### Note: 
I am currently working on switching "What-s-the-Weather-Like" from the *Open Weather Map API* to the *[Wearther Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/)* due to it using an HTTPS connection rather than an HTTP connection.
